    "Machine learning models can incorporate unintentional bias, which can lead to issues with *fairness*. For example, a model that predicts the likelihood of diabetes might work well for some age groups, but not for others - subjecting a subset of patients to unnecessary tests, or depriving them of tests that would confirm a diabetes diagnosis.\n",

To avoid potential conflicts, you're going to create a separate Conda environment and associated Jupyter kernel specifically for this exercise. If you have not already done so, <u>close this notebook</u> and use the instructions in [Analyzing and Mitigating Unfairness in Models](./labdocs/Lab11.md) to set up the Conda environment. Then reopen this notebook and connect it to the **aml-fair** kernel to continue."
