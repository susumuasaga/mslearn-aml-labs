    "This is a simple example, designed to demonstrate the principle. In reality, you could build more sophisticated logic into the pipeline steps - for example, evaluating the model against some test data to calculate a performance metric like AUC or accuracy, comparing the metric to that of any previously registered versions of the model, and only registering the new model if it performs better.\n",

    "You can use the [Azure Machine Learning extension for Azure DevOps](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-air-aiagility.vss-services-azureml) to combine Azure ML pipelines with Azure DevOps pipelines (yes, it *is* confusing that they have the same name!) and integrate model retraining into a *continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD)* process. For example you could use an Azure DevOps *build* pipeline to trigger an Azure ML pipeline that trains and registers a model, and when the model is registered it could trigger an Azure Devops *release* pipeline that deploys the model as a web service, along with the application or service that consumes the model."
